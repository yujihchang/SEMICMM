# SEMICMM
SEMICMM is an R package that implements the methods proposed in:
Yu, J.-C. and Huang, Y.-T. (2023). Unified semicompeting risks analysis of hepatitis natural history through mediation modeling. Statistics in Medicine. doi:10.1002/sim.9862

The package provides a framework to analyze semicompeting risks data with a causal mediation perspective. It is motivated by the natural history of hepatitis, where an intermediate non-terminal event (e.g., cirrhosis) may mediate the effect of hepatitis B infection on a terminal event (e.g., liver cancer or death).

R package implementing three methods—Copula MLE, and Frailty-based DE/IE (r=0 for multistate models) decomposition—for semicompeting-risks mediation analysis motivated by the hepatitis natural-history study.
